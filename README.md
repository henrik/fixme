# fixme

FIXME comments that raise after a certain point in time:

```
FIXME "2014-07-31: Stop hard-coding currency."
currency = "USD"
```

This library makes a `FIXME()` method available everywhere.

Starting July 31st 2014, the "FIXME" line in the example above would raise `Fixme::UnfixedError` with the message `"Fix by 2014-07-31: Stop hard-coding currency."`

You may want to use these bad boys next to:

  * Temporary quick fixes, to ensure they really *are* temporary.
  * Code that supports legacy workflows during a transitional period.
  * Experiments, to remember to evaluate them and make a decision.
  * Anything else you can't do now but should fix later.

If `Rails.environment` (Ruby on Rails) or `ENV["RACK_ENV"]` (e.g. Sinatra) is present, it will only ever raise in the `"test"` and `"development"` environments. That is, the production app will never raise these exceptions.

If you don't want your CI server to raise, make it set the environment variable `DO_NOT_RAISE_FIXMES`. I like having CI raise them, though.

Protip: make sure it's clear from the exception or from a separate comment just what should be done â€“ sometimes not even the person who wrote the quickfix will remember what you're meant to change.

This library is an extraction of a helper (originally called `wip_raise`) we tried and liked at [Barsoom](http://barsoom.se).
