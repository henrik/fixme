# fixme

FIXME comments that raise after a certain point in time:

```
FIXME "2014-07-31: Stop hard-coding currency."
currency = "USD"
```

This library makes a `FIXME()` method available everywhere.

Starting July 31st 2014, the "FIXME" line in the example above would raise `Fixme::UnfixedError` with the message `"Fix by 2014-07-31: Stop hard-coding currency."`

You may want to use these bad boys next to:

  * Temporary quick fixes, to ensure they really *are* temporary.
  * Code that supports legacy workflows during a transitional period.
  * Experiments, to remember to evaluate them and make a decision.
  * Anything else you can't do now but should fix later.

For simplicity, the date comparison uses machine-local time (not e.g. the Rails configured time zone).

Alternatively, the `FIXME()` method can also raise if a certain version of a component is installed:

```
FIXME "rspec >= 2.11: switch to expect syntax"
```

This will raise an exception once you have rspec >= 2.11 in your bundle. For
now only the ">=" constraint is supported.

Note that this form assumes you use bundler, and it won't raise if the specified
gem is not part of the bundle.

Protip: make sure it's clear from the exception or from a separate comment just what should be done â€“ sometimes not even the person who wrote the quickfix will remember what you're meant to change.

### Environment awareness

If `Rails.env` (Ruby on Rails) or `ENV["RACK_ENV"]` (e.g. Sinatra) is present, it will only ever raise in the `"test"` and `"development"` environments. That is, the production app will never raise these exceptions.

### Do something other than raise

When these exceptions trigger on your CI server they stop the line, blocking your delivery chain until they're addressed. This could be what you want, or it could be a little annoying.

So you can configure the library to do something other than raise:

```
# In a Rails project, this might be in config/initializers/fixme.rb
Fixme.explode_with do |details|
  YourOwnCodeOrSomeLibrary.email_developers(details.full_message)
  YourOwnCodeOrSomeLibrary.notify_chat(details.full_message)
end
```

There's also `details.date`, `details.due_days_ago`, `details.message` and `details.backtrace`.

You can call `Fixme.raise_from(details)` to get the default behavior, if you want that under certain conditions:

```
Fixme.explode_with do |details|
  if details.due_days_ago > 5
    Fixme.raise_from(details)
  else
    YourOwnCodeOrSomeLibrary.notify_chat(details.full_message)
  end
end
```

### Selectively disable

If you e.g. don't want your CI server to raise, make it set the environment variable `DISABLE_FIXME_LIB`.


## Installation
