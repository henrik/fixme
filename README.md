# fixme

FIXME comments that raise after a certain point in time:

```
FIXME "2014-07-31: Stop hard-coding currency."
currency = "USD"
```

This library makes a `FIXME()` method available everywhere.

Starting July 31st 2014, the "FIXME" line in the example above would raise `Fixme::UnfixedError` with the message `"Fix by 2014-07-31: Stop hard-coding currency."`

You may want to use these bad boys next to:

  * Temporary quick fixes, to ensure they really *are* temporary.
  * Code that supports legacy workflows during a transitional period.
  * Experiments, to remember to evaluate them and make a decision.
  * Anything else you can't do now but should fix later.

For simplicity, the date comparison uses machine-local time (not e.g. the Rails configured time zone).

Protip: make sure it's clear from the exception or from a separate comment just what should be done â€“ sometimes not even the person who wrote the quickfix will remember what you're meant to change.

### Environment awareness

If `Rails.env` (Ruby on Rails) or `ENV["RACK_ENV"]` (e.g. Sinatra) is present, it will only ever raise in the `"test"` and `"development"` environments. That is, the production app will never raise these exceptions.

### Do something other than raise

When these exceptions trigger on your CI server they stop the line, blocking your delivery chain until they're addressed. This could be what you want, or it could be a little annoying.

So you can configure the library to do something other than raise:

```
# In a Rails project, this might be in config/initializers/fixme.rb:
Fixme.explode_with do |message|
  YourOwnCodeOrSomeLibrary.email_developers(message)
  YourOwnCodeOrSomeLibrary.notify_chat(message)
end
```

If you want the parsed date and the message separately, do:

```
Fixme.explode_with do |_, date, message|
  YourOwnCodeOrSomeLibrary.log(date, message)
end
```

### Selectively disable

If you e.g. don't want your CI server to raise, make it set the environment variable `DISABLE_FIXME_LIB`.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'fixme'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install fixme


## Develop

Clone the repo, then:

```
bundle  # Install gem dependencies.
rake    # Run tests.
```
